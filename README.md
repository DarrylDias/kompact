# Kompact - a free Kirby CMS theme

![Kompact](http://themes.yordanoff.net/kompact/kompact.jpg)

Kompact is a **Free** [Kirby CMS](http://getkirby.com) theme. Build with a minimalistic approach in mind, so you can focus on the content.

**[Download](https://gum.co/kompact)** it for free.

You can also check out some of my [other themes](http://themes.yordanoff.net).

# Demo
[Live demo](http://themes.yordanoff.net/kompact)

# Getting Started
Copy and paste the files from the theme’s folder to the main directory of your Kirby installation.

**WARNING**: If you want to start with the demo content used on the demo installation here: http://themes.yordanoff.net/kompact/ you have to rename the folder “_demo-content” to “content” and replace the “content” folder in your Kirby installation. **BUT** if you already have your content setup, you’re going to lose it if you replace your “content” folder!

# Customization
If you use CodeKit, feel free to import the theme’s folder to it and start making changes. CodeKit will handle the recompiling of SASS & JS thanks to the config.codekit3 file in the root directory.

You can easily change the colours and overall styles of the theme by editing and recompiling its */assets/sass styles*. As you’ll see the main colours are separated in */assets/sass/_palette.scss*. From */assets/sass/components/_typography.scss* you can easily change the font faces used for Kompact.
